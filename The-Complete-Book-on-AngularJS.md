#Introducing Data Binding in AngularJS#

    1. Instead of merging data into a template and replacing a DOM element, AJ creates live templates as a View.

    2. Individual components of the views are dynamically interpolated live.

    3. ng-app attribute declares that everything inside of it belongs to this Angular App.

    4. AngularJS simply remembers the value that the model contains at any given time.

         > When the Angular runtime is running, it will call $digest() to check whether
         > the value is "dirty". This process is called "Dirty Checking"
